Evolution
- Decent with Modification
 - Meaning that most changes occur BETWEEN generations and not during it.
 - Also think of it as a population which fractures, and turns into seperate populations which are culturally diverged over time -- IE waht happened with the mongrols and the cantonese.
 - Individual organisms do not evolve -- only populations can evolve <F11>ZZZ
