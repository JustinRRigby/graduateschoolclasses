My Paper
- can plants regulate the microbiome

- You want your specific aims to be parellel, and not sequential. The issue is that you do not want one specific aim to feed into the next one -- because you want both to be independant.

- Do not just use the term 'Microbiome', but find a way to differentiate it from the pop gut microbiome.

- Say 'manage' instead of 'regulate' you want empahsize that there is a definite interaction occuring between the plant and its microbiome.

- Could I look into doing this in the field -- possbily with spray induction using secodnary metabolites? It may be a really good method.

-Need to create my specific aims and hypotheses into their own section -- and then I need to actually create some hypotheses.

- Need to start thnking seriously about what my broader impacts are going to be for my project. It is really difficult to find a way to incoperate the public when it comes to this. Maybe I could spin it towards an agricultural reason.
