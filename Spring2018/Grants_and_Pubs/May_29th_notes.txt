 - Make a figure, table, or a sumamary box.

Make sure to justify the specific aim 2
 - I need to be specific about what the conditions would be -- it is better to have more control
 - Pairwise, tripple, comaprision of A. fabron and other organisms -- need to find out what species (fungi 
[Quaram sensing] - The ability for apthogens are going ot have pathogenic reactions or not (it is the release of chemical signals which induce the pathogenic response). "How much of me is there vs how much of me is not there"
	- Read relative literature on this subject and try to modify 

- Need to know if galactinol actually is a defensive compound that interacts with other bacterium 
	- Can do a pilot experiment rather quickly in order to show that galactinol has an effect on the growth/surival of bacteria.
		- need to talk to joy more about this

 - Possibly using a color coating system in order to identify the bacteria/pathogens locations -- are they in the rhizosphere or the phyllosphere?
