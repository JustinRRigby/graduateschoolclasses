Notes for 5' and 10

Evolution under canalization . . .

[|]	Canalization
	[] The process by which pheontypes are stabilizaed within species
		-	This is similar to buffering (which is the ability to keep the expression of a gene near the mean) but on an evolutionary scale.
	[] Previous research has showed that canalization is not apparent in certian regulatory networks (for the D. melanogaster abdomen patternning)
		-	However this shows nothing since it was just one observation
		
	
[|]	miRNA's
	[] The paradox of miRNA's is that they are both dispensable (meaning one could knock them out and not expect a serious phenotypic effect) and they are highly conserved.
		-	This also raises the issue that due to their redundancy they should have selection act upon them more so than usual --- due to the reduced level of purifying selection.
		-	Even if the miRNA's themselves are highly conserved -- their ability to target similar or the same genes is reduced.

The dual functions of miRNAs . . . 

[|] Models for miRNAs interactions
  []Expression-tuning motifs
	] Simple expression
		- miR --l (GoI) Literally the repression of a gene by miRNA expression
	] Coherent feed forward loop
		- A --| (GoI)
		  |        _
		  -        |      Essentially one gene represses another gene-- but also activates miR that repress the same target
		  miR ----/
	
	] Double negative feedback loop
		-	miR l-----l (GoI)

  []Expression-buffering motifs
	] Incoherent feed forward loop	
		- A --> (GoI)
		  |        _
		  v        |      Essentially one gene activates another gene-- but also activates miR that repress the same target
		  miR ----/       Definitely a model that agrees with the buffering hypothesis

	] Negative feedback loop	
		-	miRNA <---| (GoI)   The expression of itself will repress itself.
		
	] Incoherent feed forward loop
		-(GoI2)-->(GoI)
		  _        _
		  |        |      miRNA targets two genes which regulate another genes both up and down.
		  miR ---| (GoI1)
	
miRNAs and expression buffering—Evidence from . . . .

[|] Ways to control gene expression
	[] Tuning
		] The ability to adjust the MEAN expression of a gene.
			- not the same as buffering
	[] Buffering
		] Is about reducing the variance that occurs -- less noise
		] Is thought to reduce noise and stabilize the entire genome
	[*] These two controllers are focused on the gene interactiosn and not the phenotype | hard to tell canal genes in the lab due to the reduced noises needed by researchers.
	
	
miRNAs and expression buffering—Evidence from recent experiments . . 
[|]	Figure 2

- Overall the expression changes in the miRNA310 knock out has a great degree of effects on the entire genome with many significantly disregualted genes.
- The change in the expected region was minor comapred to what was see overall -- even if it was significant.

[|] Figure 3

- We can see some variation in the level of target expression dependant on the level of miRNA expressed -- however it is still very noisy and not convicible.
- Still no relationship.

[|] Figure 4

- The minimum 8 seed section of miRNA is highly conserved, but no evidence for completely conservation is found
- The entire 18 bp itself has a lowerr level of conservation, but still follows a similar trend.
- The rate at which miRNA hone in on a target is a small time frame, but follows the neutral model of evolution.

Coupled Evolution of Transcription and mRNA Degradation

[|] Figure 1
	- a) Both species tend to have degregation occur at the same rate.
	- b) Both species tended to have the same level of correlation with their mRNA degredation rates, alongside
	- c) Scatterplot showing their relatively degredation rates to one another.
	- d) There was a differnce in the level of oxidative phosphorylation genes - meaning there is regulation occuring in these genes between these two species.
	
	Figure 2
	- a) We can gleam from this plot that the red section contains regulatory noise and the red section contains bioliogicaly relevant genes -- this is a sliding window look at expression.,
	- b) I have trouble interpretting this
	- c) Same idea as a) but with opposite effects
	- d) the degridation rates of degredation and transcription are diffferent.
	
	Figure 3
	- a) Compares the relative levels of gene degredation between C cer/ C par
		' We can begin to tease out the cis reg and trans reg individual genes which are disregualted between the species to find their connections to mRNA degredation
	- b) Zoomed in view of what 
	
	Figure 4
	- There is a weird difference in degregation when comparing all cis and trans effects in a matrice.
