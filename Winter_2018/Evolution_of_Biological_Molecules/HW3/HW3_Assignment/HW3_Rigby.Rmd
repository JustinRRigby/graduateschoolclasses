2. Run the analysis for the JC69 model.  
  
a. What is the ln-likelihood of the tree and JC69 model? Write the generalized expression for the likelihood (don't try to calculate it: it's too small!). Why is it so small? Does this mean the tree is almost certainly incorrect (2pt)?  
  
$L(JC69) = \frac{1}{3}*P_{diff} = \frac{1}{4} -  \frac{1}{4}e^{-\frac{4}{3}b}$  
b = Branch Length  
  
Log-likelihood = -5455.9  
The very small value for the log-likelihood just indicates that the model used was not appropiate for the situation -- thus the negative large value.
  
b. What is the sister-group of chimpanzee in this analysis? What is the value of the approximate likelihood ratio statistic supporting this grouping (1pt)?  
  
The sister group is humans.  
Log-likelihood value = 0.0556
  
  
a. How many extra degrees of freedom does this model have compared to JC69 (1pt)?  
  
It has four degrees of freedom (HKY85) while the JC69 model has zero degrees of freedom since the allele frequencies are fixed to 0.25. Thus it is 4 extra degrees of freedom.  
  
b . What is the ln-likelihood of the model? Calculate the LRS relative to JC69 and determine which is the better model (2pt).  
  
HYK85  
Ln-likelihood = -5232.71671  
  
JC69  
Ln-likelihood = -5455.90164  
  
$LR~=~\frac{L(M_{HYK85}}{M_{JC69}} = \frac{-5232.71671}{-5455.90164} = 0.9590929$  
  
The simpilar model (JC69) is more likely since the ratio is less than 1.  
  
c. What is the sister-group of chimps in this analysis? What is the value of the approximate likelihood ratio statistic supporting this grouping (1pt)?  
  
The sister group to chimpanzees is Humans like before. The likelihood ratio statistic is 0.0549 which is only slightly higher than the JC69 model.  
  
  
d. Examine the _stat file. What is the maximum likelihood estimate of the frequency of the four nucleotides in the dataset (1pt)?  
  
f(A)= 0.31363  
f(C)= 0.29735  
f(G)= 0.10337  
f(T)= 0.28565  
  
a. How does this model differ from the model you used in the last problem? How many extra degrees of freedom does it have (2pt)?  
  
It differs due to the use of a gamma distrubution in conjunction with a standard HKY85 model. It also gains one additional degree of freedom.
  
b . Calculate the LRS and evaluate whether which of the three models you have evaluated is the best model (1pt).  
  
  
$LR~=~\frac{L(M_{HYK85}}{M_{JC69}} = \frac{-5232.71671}{-5455.90164} = 0.9590929$  
  
$LR~=~\frac{L(M_{HYK85_Gamma}}{M_{JC69}} = \frac{-5030.81367}{-5455.90164} = 0.9220866$  
  
$LR~=~\frac{L(M_{HYK85}}{M_{HYK85_Gamma}} = \frac{-5232.71671}{-5030.81367} = 1.040133$  
    
From the log likelihood ratios we can see that the best model for this systems is the JC69 model
  
c. What is the sister-group of chimps in this analysis? What is the support for this grouping (1pt)?  
  
The sister group for chimps is again humans with a slightly higher bootstrap value (0.0628) than before.  
  
  
d. Examine the _stat file. What is the estimate of alpha, the shape parameter of the gamma distribution? What is the approximate shape of the distribution? (You can use a reference here or plot the distribution given alpha. An approximate shape is sufficient.) (1pt)  
  
$\alpha = 0.364$
  
```{r}
r <- seq(0.01, 2, length =10000)
xr <- dgamma(r, 0.364)
plot(r, xr, xlab = 'X-Value', ylab = 'Probability')  
```
  
  
6. From all the models you have compared, what do you consider the best model of sequence evolution to be (1pt)?
  
From the log-likelihood ratios I find that the JC69 is best suited for this particular data set -- which ends up being the simplest model.  
  
  
7. Based on these analyses, would you conclude that gorillas or humans are the sister group of chimps? Justify your answer (1pt)  
  
In every tree created in this analysis we have seen that humans and chimpanzees are found to be sister taxa. However, the bootstrap values for the relationship are poor (sub 0.100) so the relationship is not that strong.
