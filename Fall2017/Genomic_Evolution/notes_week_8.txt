Notes for Week 8

- Main issue with this paper is that they take a reducitonist view of the pathway -- but then try and move backwards.
	- Creates bias in the way the pathway would be viewed.
	- "Common Molecular Biology problem -- taking the reductionist view" - Chung-I

- Think of this as when the economy was infused with cash (in 2008 for $500)
- Think about how

[In vivo work of miRNA in a C. Elegans host]

-Many genes working towards one goal -- epistasis.

-Gene interactions are the rules of an organism (think of strerility that occurs in the cross between a horse and a donkey). 
	- Thus we assume there are no bad genes and that it is a complex network.

- Knocking out one gene to check the development is a viable option, but it does not show everything.
	- Single gene approaches do not meet the requirement of human society since it is more complicated than that.

Overconservation: The conservation of more bp than are needed.
	- COnservaiton happens over many many species in order to be valid -- chimps and humans are way too close!!!

- Pop gen only looks at one phenotype -- fitness.
- Quantative Genetics look at the various phenotypes and do not attribute fitness!.
