Introduction
----------


Clique: When two nodes share a common neighbor.
	- cliques are rare in randomly simualted networks -- meaning that cliques must be a by-product of another force besides stochiametry.
	- As the rewiring parameter (p) fluxuates, it does not affect cliques greatly until it undoes the highly connective nodes.
Mutuality: When more than one clique are connected by loops of length.

Path lengths are shorter as the system becomes more connected. [See figure 2b]
	- The shorter the distance the quicker the rates of infection.
