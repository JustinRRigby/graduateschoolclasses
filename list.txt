To-Do List for this week

- Must finish all papers for Genomic Evolution and begin to prepare for my three fucking presentations

- Email Joy about the lab meeting coming up -- which I cannot attend due to the red-eye flight #sad

- Work on my coding projects 

- Look into a possible cause for the dark green plant material I have -- could it be caused by inadequate freeze -drying?

- Start parsing the verily site in order to find internship oppurtunities -- got to get really crafty about this.






Chirstmas Gifts

Ash
- For sure getting her nice memory foam slippers along with aloe-vera socks.
- Candles from Bath and Body works -- or some equivelent [Make sure to make note of which ones she has at her pad]
- Text her mother to see what she is getting her -- if they plan on getting her an Ipad I should get her a nice stylus.
- A new bracelet possibly -- I am not sure what kind
- Gotta get the cats something
- Treats -- for sure. Those gluten-free things at treasure island are a must for this situation. Should put them in a stoking or something.
-  



Dori
- Need to get her some beer or something to finish it off


Mum
- Have most of her gift done, but I should get her another thing -- pajamas are never a bad idea.

Ash's Mum + Step-Dad

Mum:
- I think a bottle of wine would be a nice gift -- always a nice present to get someone [talk to ash about this]

Step-Dad:
- Something to do with his weird obsessions -- should be relatively easy I think.
