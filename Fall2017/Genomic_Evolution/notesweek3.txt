Notes for Genomic Evolution Week 3

-Yeast Chromatin Evolution [Focii on Cis/Trans Formations}
- Differential effect of cis and trans confirmations affecting the level 
of chromatin availible and the ability for the gene to be turned off.

- Nearly 50% NFR's are differentially accessible.
 - cis effects are more common than trans effects -- see data.

- Cis and Trans effects act compensatorily
 -trans/cis effects are not affecting gne transcription.


#Ancesrtral Chromatin COnfiguration Constrains Chromatin ev in Drosophillia
 [] the evolution of the y chromosome is thought to be caused by the inversion and crossing over of x chromosomes causing a small y to form
   ] The X chromosome performs dosage compensation in order to cover the genes lost by the invesions and cross over.
	- Juction time:time  from egg to sexually active adult.
	- Dot chromosome:A very small chromosome (1 million basepairs).
